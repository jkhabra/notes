* Pathfinding
** What is pathfinding algorithm
 - *Pathfinding algorithm*: is to find the shortest route between two points
 - Its more practical variant on mazes solving games such as pac-man
 - It is closely related to =shortest path problem= with-in =graph tehory=
   - *Graph tehory*: examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria
     (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network
 - Pathfinding algorithm's shortest finding path ability is heavily based on =Dijkstra's algorithm=
 - *Dijkstra's algorithm*: is for finding the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in a weighted graph
   - It creates a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex, the source, to all other points in the graph
