*  Redux
** What is Redux
- Redux is a predictable state container of JavaScript apps
- It helps us to write code that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native)
- It provides a great developer experience
- It makes easy to write tests for apps
** The Redux principle
- The =createStore= factory function is used to create a =Redux STORE=
- The =Reducer= is the only mandatory argument passed into =createStore()=
- The only way to change the state is to emit an action
  - An object describing what happened
- For update the state of a app, we convey our action to the =reducer=
  - This process is mostly called dispatching an action
  - It always returns new state
- To specify how the state tree is tranformed by actions, we use =pure reducer=
