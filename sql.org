* Structures Query Language (SQL)
 - SQL is an international standard language for manipulating relation database
 - Its based on an IBM product
 - SQL can create schemas, delete them and change them
 - It can put data into schemas and remove data
 - It is data handling language but not a programming language
 - SQL is DSL(Data Sub Language) it is combination of two languages
 - Those languages are Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)
 - Schema change are part of the DDL and data changes are part of the DML
 - SQL is an ISO language based on relational algebra
   - relational algebra is a mathematical formulation

** Database Models
 - A data model comprises
   - a data structure
   - a set of integrity constrains
   - operations associated with the data structure
 - Examples of data models
   - Hierarchic
   - Network
   - Relational
 - Each model type is appropriate to particular type of problem
 - The Relational model type is the most popular

*** Relational Databases
 - The relational data mode comprises:
   - relational data structure
   - relational integrity constrains
   - relational algebra or equivalent (SQL)

**** Relational Data Structures
 - A relational data structure is a collection of table or relations
   - A relation is a collection of rows or tuples
   - A tuples is a collection of columns or attributes
   - A domain is a pool of values from which the actual attribute values are taken

*** Comments
 - The character ~'--'~, when they appear in query, indicate the start of a comment
 - Everything after that point is ignored until the end of the line
 - You can't put a comment after ~';'~, if you do it will gives a error

*** Between
 - When we dealing with dates and want specify a range of dates to check
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
   SELECT name, dob FROM driver WHERE DOB BETWEEN '1 jan 1985' and '31 dec 1999'
   #+END_SRC
 - All dates have must month and year if you just use year the query will fail
 - Between works for other things, its not just for dates

*** Null
 - The NULL value indicates that something has no real value
 - We can check NULL
