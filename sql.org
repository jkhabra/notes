* Structured Query Language (SQL)
 - SQL is an international standard language for manipulating relation database
 - SQL can create schemas, delete them and change them
 - It can put data into schemas and remove data
 - It is data handling language but not a programming language
 - SQL is DSL(Data Sub Language) it is combination of two languages
 - Those languages are Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML)
 - Schema change are part of the DDL and data changes are part of the DML
 - SQL is an ISO language based on relational algebra
   - relational algebra is a mathematical formulation

** Database Models

 - A data model comprises
   - a data structure
   - a set of integrity constrains
   - operations associated with the data structure
 - Examples of data models
   - Hierarchic
   - Network
   - Relational
 - Each model type is appropriate to particular type of problem
 - The Relational model type is the most popular model

** Relational Databases
- The relational data mode comprises:
  - relational data structure
  - relational integrity constrains
  - relational algebra or equivalent (SQL)

*** Relational Data Structures
 - A relational data structure is a collection of table or relations
   - A relation is a collection of rows or tuples
   - A tuples is a collection of columns or attributes
   - A domain is a pool of values from which the actual attribute values are take

* What is SQLite
 - SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library
 - SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine
 - Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process
 - SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files
 - SQLite supports many features of SQL and has high performance and does not support stored procedures
 - It is used by several widespread browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems (such as mobile phones)
* How to create new sqlite3 db
 - To connect to the database, we can use ~sqlite3.connect~ function by passing the name of a file to open or create it
 - When we are done working with database then we need to close the connection
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   #!/usr/bin/python
   import sqlite3
   db = sqlite3.connect('test.db')
   print 'opened database successfully'
   db.close()
   #+END_SRC
 - With ~:memory:~ argument we can create temporary DB in RAM
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   import sqlite3
   db = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
   db.close()
   #+END_SRC
 - Creating sqlite3 DB outside of python shell
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   sqlite3 test.db
   SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
   Enter ".help" for usage hints.
   sqlite> .exit
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   - ~.exit~ command terminates the interactive session of the sqlite3 command line tool
* How to create new SQLite3 table
 - To use the database, we need to get a cursor object
 - Pass the SQL statements to the cursor object to execute them, we should commit the changes
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   import sqlite3
   db = sqlite3.connect('test.db')
   cursor = db.cursor()
   cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE books(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, price TEXt) ''')
   db.commit()
   db.close()
   #+END_SRC
* Field data types in SQLite3
 - SQLite3 uses static, rigid typing
 - With static typing, the datatype of a value is determined by its container
   - The particular column in which the value is stored
** Storage Classes and Data types
- *Null*: The value is a Null value
- *Integer*: The value is single integer
- *Real*: The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number
- *Text*: The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding
- *Blob*: The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input
** SQLite Affinity Type
- Sqlite3 supports the concept of type affinity on columns
- Any column can still store any type of data
  - The preferred storage class for column is called its affinity
- *Text*: This column stores all data using storage classes NULL, TEXT or BLOB
- *Numeric*: This column may contain values using all five storage classes
- *Integer*: It behaves the same as a column with NUMERIC affinity with an exception in a CAST expression
- *Real*: It behaves like a column with NUMERIC affinity except
  - It forces integer values into floating point representation
- *None*: A column with affinity NONE does not prefer one storage class over another
  - No attempt is made to coerce data from one storage class into another

* Queries
** Insert
- To insert data we use cursor to execute the query
  e.g
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import sqlite3
  db = sqlite3.connect('data/test.db')
  cursor = db.cursor()
  title1 = 'Learning Python'
  author1 = 'Mark Lutz'
  price1 = '$36.19'
  year1 ='Jul 6, 2013'
  title2 = 'Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices For Django 1.6'
  author2 = 'Daniel Greenfeld'
  price2 = '$34.68'
  year2 = 'Feb 1, 2014'

  cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO books(title, author, price, year)
                  VALUES(?,?,?,?)''', (title1, author1, price1, year1))

  cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO books(title, author, price, year)
                VALUES(?,?,?,?)''', (title2, author2, price2, year2))

  db.commit()
  db.close()
  #+END_SRC
** Select
- We can use the SELECT statement to retrieve specific columns
- The column names follow the SELECT word
  e.g
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  SELECT * FROM books; # this prints whole table
  SELECT title, price FROM books; # it prints only price and title
  #+END_SRC
- We can rename the column names of the returned result
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  SELECT title, price AS 'Price of book' form books;
  #+END_SRC
- We can use the ~LIMIT~ clause to limit the data amount returned by the statement
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  SELECT * FROM books LIMIT 4;
  SELECT * FROM books LIMIT 2, 4; # this statement select four rows skipping the first two
  #+END_SRC
** Update
- An UPDATE statement is used to modify a subset of the values stored in zero or more rows of the database table
  - Identified by the qualified-table-name specified as part of the UPDATE statement
- If the UPDATE statement does not have a WHERE clause, all rows in the table are modified by the UPDATE
- Otherwise, the UPDATE affects only those rows for which the WHERE clause
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import sqlite3

  conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')
  print "Opened database successfully";

  conn.execute("UPDATE books set price = 25000.00 Where id=1")
  conn.commit
  print "Total number of rows updated :", conn.total_changes

  cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * from books")
  conn.close()
  #+END_SRC
** Delete
- The DELETE command removes records from the table identified by the qualified-table-name
- If the WHERE clause is not present, all records in the table are deleted
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import sqlite3

  conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')
  print "Opened database successfully";

  conn.execute("DELETE FROM books WHERE id=2;")
  conn.commit
  print "Total number of rows deleted :", conn.total_changes
  conn.close()
  #+END_SRC
** Where
- The sqlite3 WHERE clause is used to filter the results form a ~SELECT~, ~INSERT~, ~UPDATE~ and ~DELETE~
  e.g
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  SELECT * FROM books WHERE price = '$30.90';
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE (last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'Jane')
  OR (employees_id = 1);
  #+END_SRC
** Order by
- SQLite3 table stores rows in an unspecified order
- To sort result set we use ~Oder by~
- The ~ASC~ keyword sorts the data in ascending order, the ~DESC~ in descending order
  e.g
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  SELECT * FROM cars ORDER BY price; -- the default sorting is ascending order
  SELECT name, price FROM cars ORDER by price DESC;
  #+END_SRC

** Distinct
 - The ~DISTINCT~ clause is used to select only unique items form the result set
   #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
   SELECT DISTINCT customer FROM oders WHERE customer LIKE 'B%';
   # It will remove duplicate items
   #+END_SRC

** Group by
 - The ~GROUP BY~ clause is used to combine database records with identical values into a single record
 - It is often used with the aggregate functions
 - For each group, we can apply an aggregate function such as MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, or AVG
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
   SELECT sum(orderPrice) AS Total, customer FROM orders GROUP BY customer;
   # its output looks like that
   Total       Customer
   ----------  ----------
   440         Black
   860         Brown
   340         Robertson
   2040        Smith
   1250        Williamson

   #+END_SRC
 - We cannot use the WHERE clause when aggregate functions are used
 - We use the HAVING clause instead
   #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
   SELECT sum(orderPrice) AS Total, customer FROM orders GROUP BY customer HAVING sum(orderPrice)>1000;
   # its output look like that
   Total       Customer
   ----------  ----------
   2040        Smith
   1250        Williamson
   #+END_SRC
** Comments
 - The character ~--~, when they appear in query, indicate the start of a comment
 - Everything after that point is ignored until the end of the line
 - You can't put a comment after ~;~, if you do it will gives a error

** Between
 - When we dealing with dates and want specify a range of dates to check
   e.g
   #+BEGIN_SRC sql
   SELECT name, dob FROM driver WHERE DOB BETWEEN '1 jan 1985' and '31 dec 1999'
   #+END_SRC
 - All dates have must month and year if you just use year the query will fail
 - Between works for other things, its not just for dates

** Null
 - The NULL value indicates that something has no real value
 - We can

** Having
 - SQLite ~HAVING~ clause is an optional clause of the ~SELECT~ statement
 - The HAVING clause specifies a search condition for a group
 - We often use HAVING clause with the ~GROUP BY~ clause
 - If we use HAVING clause without the GROUP BY clause, it behaves like a ~WHERE~ clause
 - The HAVING is applied after GROUP BY, while the WHERE is applied before
 - Example: Check [[*Group by][Group By]]
** Like
 - ~LIKE~ condition allows wildcards to be used in the WHERE clause of a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE
 - This allows us to perform pattern matching
 - Syntax: expression LIKE pattern
   - /expression/: A character expression such as a column or field
   - /pattern/: A character expression that contains pattern matching
     - *%*: Allows us to match any string of any length
     - *-*: Allows us to match on a single character
 - e.g
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%e%';
#+END_SRC

** In
- The ~IN~ condition is used to help reduce the need to use multiple ~OR~ conditions
- Syntax: expression IN(value, value2,..........value_n);
- The In condition is also called the SQLite IN operator
  e.g
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name IN ('john', 'Jane', 'Heather');
  #+END_SRC
- It would return all rows form the employees table where the first_name is either john, Heather or Jane
- Because the * used in the SELECT, all field would appears in the result set

** NOT
 - The SQLite NOT Condition (also called the NOT Operator)
   is used to negate a condition in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement
 - Syntax: NOT condition
   #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
   SELECT *
   FROM employees
   WHERE department IS NOT NULL;
   # it would return all records from the employees
     table where the department does not contain a NULL value
   #+END_SRC

** AND OR
- The SQLite AND condition and OR condition can be combined in a
  SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement
- When combining these conditions, it is important to use parentheses
- So that the database knows what order to evaluate each condition
- Syntax
  #+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
  WHERE condition1 AND condition2 OR condition_n;
  #+END_SRC
** Explain
 - It used for describing the details of table

* Field constraints
 - Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table
 - These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table
 - This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database
 - Constraints could be column level or table level
 - Column level are applied only to one column
   but table level constraints are applied to the whole table
 - Commonly used constraints are:
   - *NOT NULL Constraints* : Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value
   - *DEFAULT*: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified
   - *UNIQUE*: Ensures that all values in a column are different
   - *PRIMARY KEY*: Uniquely identified each rows/records in a database table
   - *CHECK*: The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions
   - *Foreign key*: A foreign key is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table
     - Foreign key constraints are used to enforce "exists" relationships between tables
       e.g
       #+BEGIN_SRC sql
       CREATE TABLE artists (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT,
       gender char(1) CHECK (gender in ('M', 'F')) );


       CREATE TABLE tracks (
       traid INTEGER,
       title TEXT,
       artist INTEGER,
       FOREIGN KEY(artist) REFERENCES artists(id) );

       INSERT INTO artists VALUES (1, "Tom Chapin");
       INSERT INTO artists VALUES (2, "Harry Chapin");

       /* Tom's songs */
       INSERT INTO tracks VALUES (1, "Great Big Words", 1);
       INSERT INTO tracks VALUES (1, "This Pretty Planet", 1);
       /* Harry's songs */
       INSERT INTO tracks VALUES (2, "Cat in the Cradle", 2);

       /* It won't let us do this, because 3 isn't an artist id:*/
       INSERT INTO tracks VALUES (2, "Cat in the Cradle", 3);
       #+END_SRC
